    Implementing the sizes of the fruits and leaves that existed but were not measured.
    For fruit, mapping sizes between measured fruits. For example, if (1) proximal (id_fruit=1), (2) middle, and (3) distal fruits on a truss were recorded, then fruit sizes between (1) and (2) are proportionally mapped on id_truss based on the sizes of (1) and (2).
